# Instructions for Sex Dice game

I installed Pygame from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/.
Find the wheel that corresponds to your Python version and architecture (Windows 32-bit or 64-bit).
Then just run pip install <wheel-name>. For Ubuntu I just used sudo apt-get install pygame (I think...).

Since I use Python 64-bit I installed PIL (Python imaging library) with the following:
https://github.com/lightkeeper/lswindows-lib/blob/master/amd64/python/PIL-1.1.7.win-amd64-py2.7.exe?raw=true

I haven't installed PIL for Ubuntu yet, so I'll get back to you on that.
But that should be all of it, enjoy!
